This is a Rust based implementation of the programming language Lox from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

I'm working through the C based implementation of Lox in this repo: https://github.com/16dprice/clox. The code in this Rust repo is based on what I've done there. I've obviously tweaked things along the way because of the myriad semantic differences between Rust and C, but it's probably not too far off.
